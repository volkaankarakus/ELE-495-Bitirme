Bottom selection on the left screen :
"YES ","NO ","TOILET ","TOUR ","CHAIR ",
"BED ","TV ","BOOK ","COFFEE ","MUSIC ",

The tables are divided into small squares, the background of the found square is white and its writing is black, 
the squares shift every 3 seconds, and the background of the next square changes from black to white, and writing from white to black.
It is enough to keep the eye closed for 3 seconds to make a choice.


The selection is written on a separate white screen, so the ALS patient indicates their status or wish.



After making a selection, the patient comes back to the start screen and can print another word again with the same steps.
